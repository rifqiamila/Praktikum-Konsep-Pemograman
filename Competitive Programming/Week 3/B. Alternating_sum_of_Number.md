You are given a sequence of integers. Output the alternating sum of this sequence. In other words, output a1 - a2 + a3 - a4 + a5 - . . . .. That is, the signs of plus and minus alternate, starting with a plus.

## Input
The first line of the test contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Then follow t test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the length of the sequence. The second line of the test case contains n integers a1, a2, ...., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100).

## Output
Output t lines. For each test case, output the required alternating sum of the numbers.
